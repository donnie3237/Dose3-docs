&nbsp;&nbsp;Fastify is a fast and low-overhead web framework for Node.js. It is inspired by Hapi and Express, but it is designed to be even faster and more extensible. Fastify is highly performant, and it can serve up to 30,000 requests per second. It is also very extensible, and it has a powerful plugin architecture.
