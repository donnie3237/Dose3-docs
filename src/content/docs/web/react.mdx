&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ReactJS, or simply React, is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React is commonly used for building single-page applications where the content is dynamically updated without needing to reload the entire page.
