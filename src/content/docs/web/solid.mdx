&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SolidJS is a modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It is designed to be performant, easy to use, and developer-friendly. SolidJS is inspired by React and Svelte, and it combines the best of both worlds.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SolidJS is a good choice for developers who want to build performant, easy-to-maintain web applications. It is also a good choice for developers who are new to JavaScript frameworks.
